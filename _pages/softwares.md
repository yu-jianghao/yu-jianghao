I usually write some small code/summary note to accelerate my research and sometimes write just for fun. 


## Some small softwares that I have written for my research (currently internal access)

* **ABC4EFT**: The mathematica Package: Amplitude Basis Construction for Effective Field Theories. Available at [HEPForge](https://abc4eft.hepforge.org) now.

* **SpinorCalc**: spinor calculation. Will update. 

* **AnRoot**: Event simulations based on ROOT. Will update. 

* **EventMC**: small code on Monte Carlo event generator. Will update. 

* **DMEFT**: Effective field theory treatment on the dark matter direct detection. Will update. 

* **nuEFT**: Effective field theory treatment on the neutrino properties. Will update. 


## Some technical/summary notes I have written for my research (currently internal access)

* effective field theory: framework and applications, will update

* chiral Lagrangian and CCWZ description, will update

* spinor helicity formalism, will update 

* review on new physics models, will update 

* quantum Boltzmann equation, will update 

* nuclear matrix element and response function, will update 

* ...
